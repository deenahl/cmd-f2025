## Inspirationüí°
We aimed to make mental health support accessible to everyone by integrating it into an engaging, gamified experience. Drawing inspiration from farming games, we reimagined the genre to encourage daily mental wellness practices, seamlessly blending self-care with immersive gameplay.

## What it does üîç
Mindful Meadows encourages players to cultivate both their farm and their well-being through engaging mental health exercises like journaling, deep breathing, and stretching. As players explore their land and consistently practice self-care, their crops flourish, reflecting their personal growth and progress.

## How we built it ü¶æ
We used React to make the UI components, like the timer, journal, information screens and Phaser.js was used for the game engine. The game consists of a tile-based map and a sprite-based dynamic character design.

## Challenges we ran into üß†
Integrating the React UI components with the Phaser game engine
Creating dynamic components based on user interactions
Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we were able to complete the project using a framework we have not used before. We made a small game!!

## What we learned ‚úçÔ∏è
This was a fun and challenging learning experience for all of us. 2/3 of our team members have no experience in building video games, and this was an introduction to rendering and how to create video games. Additionally, we all learned a new technology using Phaser.js.

## What's next for Mindful Meadows‚ùì
For the future, we would like to track user progress of different tasks and utilize a database to store user data. With this, we hope to show the user's progress as plant growth in their meadow. Adding more quick mental health exercises would provide users more variety and hopefully find exercise they like. Lastly, it would be great to add more animations and add more animated elements to the UI.
